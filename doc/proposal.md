# Flights Data Visualizer

# Project Summary
This project analyzes flight data from 2015, including airline information, airports, and flight details. We examine flight delays, cancellations, and other factors affecting air travel in the United States. By studying historical data, we aim to improve travel planning, help passengers make informed decisions, and enhance airline and airport operations. Our analysis provides insights into flight performance, reliability, and potential optimizations, benefiting both travelers and the aviation industry.
## Data Summary
This dataset comprises three main files: "airlines.csv," "airports.csv," and "flights.csv." "airlines.csv" contains ATA codes and airline names. "airports.csv" includes details such as airport names, locations, and codes. "flights.csv" offers a comprehensive view of flight data for 2015, featuring flight dates, airline information, departure and arrival details, scheduled and actual times, delays, cancellations, and more. These datasets enable in-depth analysis of airline operations, airport performance, and flight-related insights, making them valuable resources for various applications in the aviation industry and travel planning.
## Description
This project involves the comprehensive analysis of a dataset from the U.S. Department of Transportation's Bureau of Transportation Statistics, focusing on flight data for the year 2015. The dataset encompasses three primary components: "airlines.csv," "airports.csv," and "flights.csv."

The goal of this project is to extract valuable insights from these datasets. This includes examining airline performance, airport operations, flight delays, cancellations, and their underlying causes.By leveraging data analysis we want travelers to make informed choices by analyzing historical flight data. Predict and mitigate flight disruptions, recommend reliable airlines and airports, and offer alerts where needed. 

## Functionality of web app
* User log in and log out
* Statistics on flights:

  * Visualizations of arrival and departure punctuality for a given flight schedule (like AA123, UA899, etc.)
  * Best month to travel that route

* Statistics per Airport Data:
  * Top arriving and departing airlines
  * Average taxi times
  * Punctuality for flights
  * Busiest airports
* Statistics on Airlines:
  * Determining Hub for that airline
  * Delay stats
  * Operating times visualization

* Statistics on cities:
  * Best airlines to travel between the cities (average flight time + taxi in + taxi out)

* Stretch goals:
  * Best route between 2 cities using connecting flights and wait times
  * Best routing (small airports to small airports or route via large airports)

## Realness and Usefulness

The project allows for users to make wise travel choices while traveling by giving them insights and analytics on the best times of the year to fly with an airlines, the best airline to fly between source and destination. It also establishes transparency and accountability for airport operations by showing operational data.
